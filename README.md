# ANLY580-Final-Project
## Text Summarization
### Group Members: Yutao Chen, Yichen Liu, Ziyue Li, Haoxuan Weng

We use both extractive methods and abstractive methods to compare the performance of different models in text summarization. 
The data sets are uploaded, namely, text.csv and train.csv.

We use train.csv to train the LSTM model, and use test.csv to test the performance.
We also use pretrained 100 dimension Glove for word embedding.
